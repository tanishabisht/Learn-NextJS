## CSS Styling Options in Next.js
There are several methods to handle CSS in your Next.js projects:
- **Global Stylesheet**: Standard CSS files that affect all components globally.
- **Styled JSX**: Enables scoped CSS support in React components. More details can be found on the [Next.js blog](https://nextjs.org/blog/styling-next-with-styled-jsx).
- **CSS Modules**: CSS files in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.


## Next.js inbuilt dependencies and features
- **next/link**: Simplifies navigation between pages (`<Link href="/path"><a>Link Text</a></Link>`).
- **next/router**: Facilitates programmatic navigation (`useRouter`, `Router.push()`).
- **next/image**: Optimized image component (`<Image src="/path/to/image" alt="description" />`).
- **next/head**: Allows you to manipulate the `<head>` of a page (`<Head><title>Page Title</title></Head>`).
- **getStaticProps**: Fetches data at build time to pass as props to your page.
- **getStaticPaths**: Determines dynamic paths based on the data fetched.
- **_error.js**: Handles custom rendering of error pages, like 404 Not Found.
